# Specifications

This directory contains formal specifications that define UAS contracts.

Specs are written **before code**. Code must conform to specs — not the other way around.

## Contents

*This directory will be populated in Phase 1 — Core Concepts & Contracts.*

Planned specs:
- `install-recipe.md` — Format and validation rules for install recipes
- `profile.md` — Format and validation rules for environment profiles
- `execution-lifecycle.md` — State machine for the installation execution lifecycle
