License Reasoning:

MIT was chosen because:

1. SIMPLICITY — MIT is the most widely understood open-source license.
   Contributors and users don't need a lawyer to understand their rights.

2. PERMISSIVENESS — UAS is an environment setup tool. Restricting how people
   use it (copyleft) would limit adoption in corporate environments where
   developers need it most.

3. ECOSYSTEM COMPATIBILITY — Most of our likely dependencies (Node.js
   ecosystem, Electron/Tauri) are MIT or similarly permissive. No license
   conflict risk.

4. COMMUNITY GROWTH — Permissive licensing encourages forks, integrations,
   and contributions without legal friction.

Alternatives considered:

- Apache 2.0: Patent clause is nice but adds complexity we don't need yet.
- GPL/AGPL: Would reduce corporate adoption. UAS is a tool, not a library
  that needs copyleft protection.
- ISC: Equivalent to MIT but less recognized.
